This is a website for playing combinatorial games against your computer. So far, we have 5 different games (each with their own settings), for you to play.
* Nim: The classic impartial game. Take turns removing chips from piles and try to be the player to take the last chip!
* Chessboard: Take turns moving a chess piece closer to one corner of the board. Whoever moves the chess piece last wins!
* Kayles: Take turns bowling down pins, aiming to knock over the last pin standing.
* Notakto: Tic-tac-toe, but both players are X's.
* Blue-Red-Green Nim: A partizan variation of Nim, which is much harder!

The website is currently hosted at [https://zach-winkeler.github.io/games/](https://zach-winkeler.github.io/games/). I use them as activities whenever I teach fun math classes for middle/high schoolers.

See README-create-react-app.md for information on running this app yourself.
